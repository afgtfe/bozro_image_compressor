Effective Date: 1 August 2024

1. Introduction Your privacy is our top priority. This Privacy Policy explains how BOZRO Image Compressor handles your information. We are committed to protecting your personal data and providing a secure user experience.

2. Information Collection and Use

• Personal Data: The developer of this app does not collect, store, or share any of your private personal information, such as your name, phone number, email address, or precise location.

• Third-Party Services (AdMob): We use Google AdMob for advertising. Google may collect and use certain non-personal technical data (such as your device's Advertising ID) to show personalized ads. AdMob may also use local caching to store ad assets (like images or video clips) on your device to ensure faster loading and reduce data usage. Review Google’s policy here: https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads.

3. Image Processing and Data Caching

• On-Device Processing: All image compression and optimization are performed locally on your device. Your images are never uploaded to our servers or any third-party cloud services.

• Temporary Caching: To provide a fast and smooth experience, the app uses temporary storage (cache) on your device.

◦ Purpose: This is used to hold images during the compression process or to temporarily store files before you choose to save or share them.

◦ Management: These cached files are temporary and are typically managed by your device's operating system. They are usually cleared when the app is closed or when storage space is needed by the system.

• Saving & Sharing: When you save or share a compressed image, it is written directly to your device's storage or passed securely to other apps (like WhatsApp, Gmail, etc.) via the standard Android System Sharing Intent.


4. Security of Your Information We value your trust in providing us your information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

5. Permissions and Their Necessity To provide its features, the app requires the following permissions:

• Camera: Used to capture new photos within the app for immediate compression.

• Storage (Read/Write/Media Access): Used to select existing images from your gallery and to save the final compressed images back to your device.

• Internet: Used solely to load advertisements from Google AdMob and to visit external links (like "Rate Us" or our website).

6. Children’s Privacy Our app is safe for all ages. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Since no personal data is collected by the developer, we are fully compliant with children's privacy regulations.
